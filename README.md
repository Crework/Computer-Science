### What is Programming? (more importantly, why do we code?)

Did you just decide that you want to learn how to code? Is this your day 0 and you are just looking for best resources to get you started and make you understand what exactly is programming and why do we need it? 

If yes, then you are in luck. You will find eveything here. You can even do a Computer Science Degree without going to college or without paying any money. You can check that out later [here.](#introduction-to-computer-science)

For now, go to this link and take a look at this 1 hour and 30 minutes video. Potentially, it could change your life if you fall in love with programming because of this, but we can't promise anything.

Now, after watching this video, you know what programming is. Let's dig a bit deeper now.

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. This course is self-paced, allowing you to adjust the number of hours you spend per week to meet your needs.

**Topics covered**:
`simple programs`
`simple data structures`

### Introduction to Computer Science

This course will introduce you to the world of computer science. Students should take this course for a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, Computer Science is likely for you!

| Course no. | Courses | Duration | Prerequisites |
| ------| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| 1 | [Class Lectures from MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA) | 9 weeks | High School Maths |
| 2 | [Video Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJdqdXieSHN0U9AdnmwD-9QcR9hmw04d) | 9 weeks | High School Maths |

Both of these lectures are technically the same, the only difference is in the mode of teaching. If you like recorded videos of lectures with professors teaching in classroom, you should choose course 1. If you like a teacher teaching you on a laptop with more hands on experience that you can follow, go with course 2.

### Math Elective Courses

**You can choose one/more of the following topics**: calculus, linear algebra, or probability.

I will personally recommend you to go through Calculus/ Linear Algebra if you are not familiar with these topics already. If you are, just skip this elective section.

#### Calculus
